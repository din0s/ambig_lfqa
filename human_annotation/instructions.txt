In this document, we give some guidelines on how to perform pairwise comparisons. Before proceeding, please take a look at `screenshot.png` to familiarize yourself with the annotation interface.

Overall, each pairwise comparison consists of two parts: Evaluation 1 and Evaluation 2.


+++++Evaluation 1.+++++

First, annotators should evaluate the QA accuracy of each long-form answer **separately**. For each long-form answer and each QA pair, annotators need to check if this QA pair is captured in the long-form answer, that is, check whether the disambiguated question Q can be correctly answered from the long-form answer. If the QA pair is captured in the long-form answer, annotators should check the corresponding checkbox.

Importantly, in this stage, long-form answers **are not compared directly** and the accuracy of each answer is evaluated independently. If both long-form answers capture a QA pair, both checkboxes need to be checked. Similarly, if both long-form answers do not capture a QA pair, both checkboxes should be left unchecked.


+++++Evaluation 2.+++++

In the second part of the evaluation, annotators need to compare the long-form answers on three criteria:

1. Which paragraph is better in terms of resolving ambiguity? To answer this question, evaluate wheter a user can understand the source of ambiguity in their question after reading the long-form answer.

2. Which paragraph is better in terms of fluency? Identify the answer which is more fluent and coherent.

3. Which paragraph is better overall? Now combine all dimensions (accuracy, quality of disambiguation, and fluency) into an overall comparison. Which answer you would be happier with overall?
